High performance math library for Unity

## What is this and why is it empty?
This is a project to build a geometry library to be used with Unity's Burst compiler and jobs scheduler. This is based on work I did at my previous job at VR development company Upknowledge. Unfortunately all that work is under NDA so it needs to be reimplemented from scratch which will be a slow process as I'm currently busy with uni and my current job.

## What to expect then?
Generally speaking these are the features that I aim to implement based on what had been done before and previous plans to improve it:
- Generic math operations library for other features
- Geometry intersection tests (raycast, distance, aabb overlaps, etc)
- Bounding box hierarchy
- Geometry processing (for bvh)

Ideally in the future:
- Mesh simplification
- Other things I find useful in my other projects
